# Project Pitch Name Soundscape

## Elevator

The idea of having a band, DJ, or even a sound system availiable at events often falls as a last minute issue. This relies on favors of people who HAVE the equipment, the client who needs the equipment, and the third person  who operates it. This excludes the venue who often does not know what they need. What if there was an app that could chart out the needed equipment, time, and configuration? This way bands, events, managers, operators of equipment and venues can have a positive experience.

## Audience

The everyday person who often doesn't run events, the wedding manager, who does not know about events, the operators of equipment, and the client wanting a good event with little knowledge on the subject.

## Benefits

A quick overview of the needed assests for an events at any scale.

## Features

## Technology

Specific APIs, integrations and technologies you expect to use.
